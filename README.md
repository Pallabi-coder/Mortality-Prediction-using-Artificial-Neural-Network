# Mortality-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
 The risk of death can be approximated by evaluating the severity of a patientâ€™s illness as determined by important physiologic, clinical, and demographic determinants.

Identification of features, correlation among them and ignoring irrelevant feature which are not useful for the prediction.
Built an Artificial Neural network model on Medical dataset to predict the mortality rate.
Improved the accuracy to 0.88%

This model can be successfully used for predicting mortality in ICUs but then one should keep in mind that these values are just predicted values and the predictions can be wrong
